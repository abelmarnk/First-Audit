## Scope
**Phase 1**  
- Full audit of the supplied Solana smart contract  

**Phase 2**  
- Full rewrite of the contract implementing the suggested fixes and improvements  

---

## Summary of Approach

### On-chain Audit
- Identify vulnerabilities that depend only on on-chain code.  
- Provide damage clarity.  
- Provide a flow that demonstrates how that vulnerability would be exploited.  
- Suggest fixes.  

### Code Rewrite
- Identify improvements.  
- Rewrite code.  
- Write tests to ensure the code works as expected.  

---

## Phase 1 â€” Audit and Fix Suggestions

### Findings

#### Vulnerability â€“ I
**Category:** Logic Error / Privilege Escalation  

**Description:**  
Anyone can create a game session and put themselves as the server/signer. This allows malicious users to manipulate game outcomes by controlling state changes and falsely recording kills.  

**Attack Flow:**  
Malicious user â†’ Creates session manually â†’ Other users join â†’ Capacity reached â†’ Malicious user records kills â†’ Wins game â†’ Funds distributed unfairly.  

**Severity:** Very High  

**Fix:**  
- Initialize program with server/admin.  
- Store admin key in global config account.  
- Restrict privileged actions (e.g., recording kills) to admin only.  

---

#### Vulnerability â€“ II
**Category:** Logic Error / Privilege Escalation  

**Description:**  
Any user can take multiple slots in a valid game, filling both teams with duplicate/dummy accounts. This allows malicious users to sabotage teams or guarantee victory.  

**Attack Flow:**
Valid game session created â†’ A few users join normally â†’ Malicious user repeatedly adds themselves (or dummy accounts) into remaining slots on both teams â†’ 
Teams fill up with duplicates/dummies â†’ Game starts â†’ Dummy players do not participate, sabotaging one team while the malicious user ensures their team wins â†’ 
Malicious user (and their duplicates) claim winnings â†’ Honest players lose their funds.

**Severity:** Very High  

**Fix:**  
- Require server signature to authorize joins.  
- Ensure uniqueness of players.  
- Optionally, add reservation of slots by players for better team integrity.  

---

#### Vulnerability â€“ III
**Category:** Economic Imbalance  

**Description:**  
This may be an intended mechanic but, in pay-to-spawn games, players with large funds can spawn endlessly, giving them a significant unfair advantage.  

**Severity:** Medium  

**Fix:**  
- Limit the number of spawns per user, by setting hard caps  
- Enforce a balanced gameplay mechanic.  

---

### Other Vulnerabilities
- Additional issues and safe guards identified such as overflow/underflow e.t.c. are documented in Phase 2 improvements.  

---

## âš¡ Phase 2 â€” Improvements

The program primarily acts as an escrow for funds transfer. Additional logic is necessary to prevent inconsistent states and exploitation. Improvements are organized file-by-file below.

---

### File-by-File Improvements

#### `create_game_session.rs`
- Bound string ID size.  
- Automatically add creator as player on creation.  
- Remove unused vault token bump.  
- Replace manual PDA space calc with `INIT_SPACE`.  
- Use `UncheckedAccount` instead of `AccountInfo`.  
- Remove unused rent sysvar.  
- Add session close flow.  

#### `distribute_winnings.rs`
- Remove unused programs from context.  
- Remove redundant session ID arg.  
- Remove duplicated authority check.  
- Close vault & token accounts post-game.  
- Handle leftover lamports (round session bet to nearest multiple of 10).  
- Optimize account lookup for O(n) instead of O(nÂ²).  
- Use `UncheckedAccount`.  
- Reduce transaction overhead by using stored pubkeys.  

#### `join_user.rs`
- Remove redundant session ID arg.  
- Mark user account as `Signer` instead of `mut`.  
- Enforce server check if Vulnerability II fix is applied.  
- Prevent duplicate joins.  
- Use `UncheckedAccount`.  

#### `pay_to_spawn.rs`
- Limit spawn purchases per player.  
- Remove redundant session ID arg.  
- Use `UncheckedAccount`.  
- Remove unused programs from context.  

#### `record_kill.rs`
- Remove redundant session ID arg.  

#### `refund_wager.rs`
- Remove redundant session ID arg.  
- Close vault & token accounts after game session.  
- Handle leftover lamports on non-multiple-of-10 bets.  
- Reduce transaction overhead by using stored pubkeys.  

#### `game_session.rs` (previously `state.rs`)
- Remove unused variables.  
- Improve `get_all_players` efficiency.  
- Remove vault token bump.  
- Use `INIT_SPACE` instead of manual calc.  
- Use checked math (`checked_*`) for counters.  
- Optimize kill/spawn functions with indexed calls.  

#### `team.rs` (previously `state.rs`)
- Optimize `add_player` by leveraging stored player count.  

#### `create_global_config.rs`
- Add instruction for initial config with admin key.  

#### `update_global_config.rs`
- Add ability to update admin keys for key rotation or ownership transfer.  

---

### General Improvements
- Remove deducible logs to save compute units, e.g logging both the total pot and all the winnings(the sum can be calculated to get the total in this case).
- Remove unnecessary mint checks.  

---

## Timeline
Project completed between **14/09/25** and **26/09/25**.  

---

## Additional Info
- All changes implemented in the [**programs**](https://github.com/abelmarnk/First-Audit/tree/main/programs/wager-program) section of this repository.
- All tests for the program rewrite can be found in the [**tests**](https://github.com/abelmarnk/First-Audit/tree/main/tests) section of this repository.

## Build Info
- The program can be built and the tests run by simply running `anchor test`, though the program binary and interface types are already provided in the `/target` folder
